# Docker hands-on workshop

**NOTE: Docker moves fast and this tutorial is now out of date. It is kept here as a reference to students who attended this workshop.**

This two hour workshop will take you from "Hello Docker" to deploying a containerized web application to a server.

## Prerequisites

There are no specific skills needed for this tutorial beyond a basic comfort with the command line and using a text editor.

It won't make much sense, though, unless you have some experience deploying and maintaining software applications in production.

## Philosophy

**There are a few things you should know about this tutorial before you begin:**

This tutorial is designed to be **self-paced** to make the most of your time.

**The exercises won't always tell you exactly what you need to do.** Instead, I will try to point you to the right resources (documentation, blog posts, etc.) to find the answer. I prefer this approach because it helps you learn how to find answers about Docker questions you have in the future.

**Please don't be shy about asking questions to the instructors or your neighbors!** We're all friendly here, and it wasn't long ago that all of us were Docker beginners. :grin:
